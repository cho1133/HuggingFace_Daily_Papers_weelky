--- 1. InternVL3.5: Advancing Open-Source Multimodal Models in Versatility,
  Reasoning, and Efficiency ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.18265

## Abstract (Original)
We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05times inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code
are publicly released.

--- 2. AgentFly: Fine-tuning LLM Agents without Fine-tuning LLMs ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.16153

## Abstract (Original)
In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation (87.88% Pass@3) and 79.40% on the test set. It reaches
66.6% F1 and 80.4% PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds 4.7% to
9.6% absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The
code is available at https://github.com/Agent-on-the-Fly/AgentFly.

--- 3. VibeVoice Technical Report ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.19205

## Abstract (Original)
This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

--- 4. Beyond Pass@1: Self-Play with Variational Problem Synthesis Sustains
  RLVR ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.14029

## Abstract (Original)
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

--- 5. rStar2-Agent: Agentic Reasoning Technical Report ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20722

## Abstract (Original)
We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates
strong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use
tasks. Code and training recipes are available at

--- 6. Pref-GRPO: Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO for Stable
  Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20751

## Abstract (Original)
Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

--- 7. Beyond Transcription: Mechanistic Interpretability in ASR ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.15882

## Abstract (Original)
Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention,
particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into
linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored
in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both
the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the
benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech
recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving
model transparency and robustness.

--- 8. Self-Rewarding Vision-Language Model via Reasoning Decomposition ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.19652

## Abstract (Original)
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucinations, saying
things that are not actually in the image, and language shortcuts, where they
skip the visual part and just rely on text priors. These issues arise because
most post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching
and supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without
explicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often
learn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To
mitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human
annotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human
annotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot
adapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to
reward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method
that improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions
via reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two
stages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted
to produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the
question without referring back the input image. To validate this
self-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language
reasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This
self-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced
training signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning.
Our experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning,
mitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts
across diverse vision-language tasks.

--- 9. TreePO: Bridging the Gap of Policy Optimization and Efficacy and
  Inference Efficiency with Heuristic Tree-based Modeling ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.17445

## Abstract (Original)
Recent advancements in aligning large language models via reinforcement
learning have achieved remarkable gains in solving complex reasoning problems,
but at the cost of expensive on-policy rollouts and limited exploration of
diverse reasoning paths. In this work, we introduce TreePO, involving a
self-guided rollout algorithm that views sequence generation as a
tree-structured searching process. Composed of dynamic tree sampling policy and
fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update
compute burden while preserving or enhancing exploration diversity. Key
contributions include: (1) a segment-wise sampling algorithm that alleviates
the KV cache burden through contiguous segments and spawns new branches along
with an early-stop mechanism; (2) a tree-based segment-level advantage
estimation that considers both global and local proximal policy optimization.
and (3) analysis on the effectiveness of probability and quality-driven dynamic
divergence and fallback strategy. We empirically validate the performance gain
of TreePO on a set reasoning benchmarks and the efficiency saving of GPU hours
from 22\% up to 43\% of the sampling design for the trained models, meanwhile
showing up to 40\% reduction at trajectory-level and 35\% at token-level
sampling compute for the existing models. While offering a free lunch of
inference efficiency, TreePO reveals a practical path toward scaling RL-based
post-training with fewer samples and less compute. Home page locates at

--- 10. MCP-Bench: Benchmarking Tool-Using LLM Agents with Complex Real-World
  Tasks via MCP Servers ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20453

## Abstract (Original)
We introduce MCP-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models
(LLMs) on realistic, multi-step tasks that demand tool use, cross-tool
coordination, precise parameter control, and planning/reasoning for solving
tasks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), MCP-Bench connects LLMs to 28
representative live MCP servers spanning 250 tools across domains such as
finance, traveling, scientific computing, and academic search. Unlike prior
API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain
operations. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework covering tool-level
schema understanding and usage, trajectory-level planning, and task completion.
Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges in MCP-Bench. Code
