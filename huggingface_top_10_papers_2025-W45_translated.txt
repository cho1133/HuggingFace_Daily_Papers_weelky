--- 1. Thinking with Video: Video Generation as a Promising Multimodal
  Reasoning Paradigm ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.04570

## Abstract (Original)
"Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.

--- 2. Diffusion Language Models are Super Data Learners ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.03276

## Abstract (Original)
Under strictly controlled pre-training settings, we observe a Crossover: when
unique data is limited, diffusion language models (DLMs) consistently surpass
autoregressive (AR) models by training for more epochs. The crossover shifts
later with more or higher-quality data, earlier with larger models, and
persists across dense and sparse architectures. We attribute the gains to three
compounding factors: (1) any-order modeling, (2) super-dense compute from
iterative bidirectional denoising, and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation;
input or parameter noise improves AR under data constraint but cannot close the
gap. At scale, a 1.7B DLM trained with a ~1.5T-token compute budget on 10B
unique Python tokens overtakes an AR coder trained with strictly matched
settings. In addition, a 1B-parameter DLM achieves > 56% accuracy on HellaSwag
and > 33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens, without any special tricks, just by
repeating standard pre-training data. We also show that rising validation
cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.

--- 3. VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual
  Representation ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.02778

## Abstract (Original)
Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

--- 4. V-Thinker: Interactive Thinking with Images ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.04460

## Abstract (Original)
Empowering Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to deeply integrate image
interaction with long-horizon reasoning capabilities remains a long-standing
challenge in this field. Recent advances in vision-centric reasoning explore a
promising "Thinking with Images" paradigm for LMMs, marking a shift from
image-assisted reasoning to image-interactive thinking. While this milestone
enables models to focus on fine-grained image regions, progress remains
constrained by limited visual tool spaces and task-specific workflow designs.
To bridge this gap, we present V-Thinker, a general-purpose multimodal
reasoning assistant that enables interactive, vision-centric thinking through
end-to-end reinforcement learning. V-Thinker comprises two key components: (1)
a Data Evolution Flywheel that automatically synthesizes, evolves, and verifies
interactive reasoning datasets across three dimensions-diversity, quality, and
difficulty; and (2) a Visual Progressive Training Curriculum that first aligns
perception via point-level supervision, then integrates interactive reasoning
through a two-stage reinforcement learning framework. Furthermore, we introduce
VTBench, an expert-verified benchmark targeting vision-centric interactive
reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V-Thinker consistently
outperforms strong LMM-based baselines in both general and interactive
reasoning scenarios, providing valuable insights for advancing
image-interactive reasoning applications.

--- 5. Don't Blind Your VLA: Aligning Visual Representations for OOD
  Generalization ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.25616

## Abstract (Original)
The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

--- 6. Every Activation Boosted: Scaling General Reasoner to 1 Trillion Open
  Language Foundation ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.22115

## Abstract (Original)
We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

--- 7. ThinkMorph: Emergent Properties in Multimodal Interleaved
  Chain-of-Thought Reasoning ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.27492

## Abstract (Original)
Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

--- 8. Scaling Agent Learning via Experience Synthesis ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.03773

## Abstract (Original)
While reinforcement learning (RL) can empower large language model (LLM)
agents by enabling self-improvement through interaction, its practical adoption
remains challenging due to costly rollouts, limited task diversity, unreliable
reward signals, and infrastructure complexity, all of which obstruct the
collection of scalable experience data. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse
experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for
autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts,
DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model
that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through
step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To
improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an
experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and
continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent
training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new
tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online
curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent
backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in
fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready
tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in
RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only
synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic
experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional
performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing
a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.

--- 9. OS-Sentinel: Towards Safety-Enhanced Mobile GUI Agents via Hybrid
  Validation in Realistic Workflows ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.24411

## Abstract (Original)
Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

--- 10. INT v.s. FP: A Comprehensive Study of Fine-Grained Low-bit Quantization
  Formats ---
Link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.25602

## Abstract (Original)
Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.
